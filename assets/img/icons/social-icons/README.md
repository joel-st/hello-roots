# hello-roots social icons

Put your `.svg` social icons into this folder. If icons exist, ACF fields will appear under `Theme Settings > Social Media Channels`.

## Naming the icons
It is recommended to just name the icon file with the channel name. Use minus (`-`) if the channel name has more than one word.

* Facebook = `facebook.svg`
* Creative Market = `creative-market.svg`
